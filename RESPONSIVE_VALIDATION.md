- iPhone 14 / 15 (standard mobile)
- iPad / iPad Mini (tablet)
- Laptop (desktop)

## Common Issues to Check

- **Horizontal Scroll**: Should never occur on any page
- **Touch Targets**: Buttons and inputs should be at least 44x44px on mobile
- **Spacing**: Adequate padding between elements (no cramped layouts)
- **Readability**: Text should be minimum 16px on mobile

## Tailwind Breakpoints Reference

- `sm:` - 640px and above
- `md:` - 768px and above
- `lg:` - 1024px and above
- `xl:` - 1280px and above

Default styles apply to mobile-first (below 640px).

## Success Criteria

All checkboxes above should be marked âœ“ for the application to be considered fully responsive and mobile-ready.

## Notes

- The application uses Tailwind CSS responsive utilities
- Most components use `max-w-*` classes to constrain width on large screens
- Flex and grid layouts adjust based on breakpoints
- Text sizing uses responsive scale where appropriate
