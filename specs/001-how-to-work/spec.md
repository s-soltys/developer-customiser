# Feature Specification: How to Work With Me App

**Feature Branch**: `001-how-to-work`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "How to work with me app, An interactive app that guides new team members through creating a comprehensive, engaging "How to Work With Me" guide through a conversational interface and questionnaire. Categories include: - Communication preferences (Slack vs email, response times, meeting preferences) - Work style (deep focus hours, collaboration preferences, timezone considerations) - Feedback style (direct vs diplomatic, frequency preferences) - Strengths & growing areas - Pet peeves & energizers - Personal context (hobbies, fun facts that help build connection). The user journey is: - I type in my name - For each category, I am shown a screen with questions - Once I provide all answers for all categories, then I see a summary screen / card which I can share with colleagues with a link"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: Can users save their progress and return later, or must they complete the questionnaire in one session? ‚Üí A: Must complete in one session (no save/resume)
- Q: Can users edit their profile after completing it? ‚Üí A: Yes, users can edit anytime
- Q: What input format should questions use? ‚Üí A: Mix of both (free text + structured choices)
- Q: Are shared profile links publicly accessible to anyone, or do they require authentication? ‚Üí A: Public - anyone with link can view
- Q: What platforms must the app support? ‚Üí A: Both desktop and mobile web (responsive)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A new team member joins an organization and wants to create a personal "How to Work With Me" guide to share with their colleagues. They open the app, enter their name, and are guided through an interactive questionnaire covering six key categories: communication preferences, work style, feedback style, strengths and growth areas, pet peeves and energizers, and personal context. After answering all questions across all categories, they receive a shareable summary card/profile that colleagues can access via a unique link to better understand how to collaborate effectively with them.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the app for the first time, **When** they enter their name and proceed, **Then** they are presented with the first category of questions
2. **Given** a user is answering questions in a category, **When** they complete all questions in that category, **Then** they advance to the next category
3. **Given** a user has completed all six categories, **When** they finish the questionnaire, **Then** they see a summary screen displaying all their responses
4. **Given** a user is viewing their completed summary, **When** they request to share it, **Then** they receive a unique shareable link
5. **Given** a colleague has a shareable link, **When** they open it, **Then** they can view the complete "How to Work With Me" profile for that person
6. **Given** a user is partway through the questionnaire, **When** they close the browser or navigate away, **Then** their progress is lost and they must start over

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user enters an invalid or empty name?
- If a user abandons mid-session, their progress is lost (no persistence between sessions)
- What happens if a user tries to share before completing all categories?
- How does the system handle very long text responses [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: are there character limits per question?]?
- What happens if someone tries to access a link that [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: has been deleted or doesn't exist?]?
- Users can edit their responses after completing the profile and regenerate the shareable link
- Can users create multiple profiles or only one? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: profile limits per user]
