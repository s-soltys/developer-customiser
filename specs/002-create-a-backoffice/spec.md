# Feature Specification: Backoffice Question Configuration

**Feature Branch**: `002-create-a-backoffice`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a Backoffice page where I can configure questions"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: backoffice interface, question configuration, admin access
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Who can access the backoffice?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What aspects of questions can be configured?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should this support creating new questions or only editing existing ones?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What categories can questions belong to?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: Admin accesses backoffice ‚Üí views questions ‚Üí configures them
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Marked ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (Question entity involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - clarification needed"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarification)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07
- Q: When an administrator deletes a question that existing users have already answered in their profiles, what should happen to those responses? ‚Üí A: Preserve responses - deleted questions become hidden but their answers remain viewable in existing profiles
- Q: How should administrators authenticate to access the backoffice? ‚Üí A: Environment variable password - single shared password set via config (simplest, no user management)
- Q: Can administrators create new categories in addition to the existing 6 categories (Communication, Work Style, Collaboration, Feedback, Boundaries, Problem Solving)? ‚Üí A: Full category management - administrators can create, edit, rename, and delete categories
- Q: Is the question order within each category enforced globally for all users, or can individual users customize their own questionnaire order? ‚Üí A: Global ordering - all users see questions in the same order set by administrators
- Q: What is the acceptable delay between when an administrator saves a change (question/category edit) and when it appears in the public-facing questionnaire? ‚Üí A: No specific requirement - can take as long as needed, user can refresh manually

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an administrator, I need to configure the questions and categories that appear in the "How to Work With Me" questionnaire so that I can customize the content without requiring code changes. This enables the application to evolve based on user feedback and changing organizational needs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an administrator is logged into the backoffice, **When** they navigate to the question configuration page, **Then** they see a list of all existing questions organized by category
2. **Given** an administrator is viewing a question, **When** they edit the question text and save, **Then** the updated question appears in the public-facing questionnaire
3. **Given** an administrator wants to add a new question, **When** they create a question with text and category, **Then** the new question becomes available in the questionnaire
4. **Given** an administrator wants to remove a question, **When** they delete the question, **Then** it no longer appears in the questionnaire but existing user responses remain preserved and viewable in their profiles
5. **Given** an administrator is editing questions, **When** they reorder questions within a category, **Then** the new order is reflected in the questionnaire
6. **Given** an administrator wants to organize questions differently, **When** they create a new category with a name, **Then** questions can be assigned to that category
7. **Given** an administrator wants to update category organization, **When** they rename or delete a category, **Then** the changes are reflected in the questionnaire
8. **Given** a user attempts to access the backoffice without the correct password, **When** they try to authenticate, **Then** they are denied access

### Edge Cases
- How does the system handle duplicate questions or empty question text?
- What happens if two administrators edit the same question simultaneously?
- What happens to questions when their category is deleted?
- What is the maximum length for question text and category names?
- Can a category be deleted if it contains questions?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a dedicated backoffice interface for question management
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all existing questions in the backoffice [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should questions be filterable or searchable?]
- **FR-003**: Administrators MUST be able to view questions organized by category
- **FR-004**: Administrators MUST be able to create new questions with text and category assignment
- **FR-005**: Administrators MUST be able to edit existing question text
- **FR-006**: Administrators MUST be able to delete questions (soft delete: hidden from new questionnaires but existing user responses preserved)
- **FR-007**: Administrators MUST be able to reorder questions within a category (order applies globally to all users)
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate that question text is not empty before saving
- **FR-009**: System MUST restrict backoffice access via password authentication (single shared password configured via environment variable)
- **FR-010**: System MUST reflect question and category changes in the public-facing questionnaire (no specific latency requirement)
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve existing user responses when questions are modified or deleted
- **FR-012**: Administrators MUST be able to assign questions to categories
- **FR-013**: Administrators MUST be able to create new categories with a name
- **FR-014**: Administrators MUST be able to rename existing categories
- **FR-015**: Administrators MUST be able to delete categories
- **FR-016**: System MUST validate that category names are not empty before saving

### Key Entities
- **Question**: Represents a configurable question in the system
  - Text content that users see
  - Category association (reference to Category entity)
  - Display order within category
  - Creation and modification timestamps
  - Active/inactive status (for soft delete: inactive questions hidden from new questionnaires)
  - Relationship to user responses in existing profiles

- **Category**: Represents a grouping of related questions
  - Category name
  - Display order (for organizing categories in the questionnaire)
  - Creation and modification timestamps
  - Active/inactive status (for soft delete)
  - Relationship to questions

- **Administrator**: User with permission to access the backoffice
  - Authenticates via single shared password
  - Password configured via environment variable (no database storage required)

## Key Clarifications Needed

1. **Authentication & Authorization**: How should administrators access the backoffice? (Single password, user accounts, role-based access?)
2. **Question Lifecycle**: Can administrators create new questions or only edit existing ones?
3. **Category Management**: Can administrators create/modify categories or only assign questions to existing categories?
4. **Data Integrity**: What happens to existing user responses when questions are edited or deleted?
5. **Delete Behavior**: Should question deletion be hard (permanent) or soft (hidden but preserved)?
6. **Question Discovery**: Should the backoffice include search/filter capabilities for questions?
7. **Question Ordering**: Is question order enforced globally or can individual users customize their questionnaire order?
8. **Concurrent Editing**: How should conflicts be handled when multiple administrators edit simultaneously?
9. **Real-time Updates**: What is the acceptable delay between question configuration changes and public questionnaire updates?
