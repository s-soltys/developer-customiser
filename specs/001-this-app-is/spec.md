# Feature Specification: Manager Mindset Feedback Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-app-is`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "This app is a fun tool that allows an manager in a tech company to ask colleagues to give them input on what kind of mindset they should have. The core user journey is: - I create my profile (no authentication!) - I get a link to my profile and share it with colleagues - When a colleage opens the screen, they see a list of questions and for each question I can configure the trait - When a colleague submits the traits, then they see a success screen and a summary of how everyone configured the profile (for example a radar chart) The list of questions is hardcoded, but should be easily configurable. Start with: - Takes on risk vs. Risk averse - Goofy vs. professional - Candid vs. diplomatic - Focused on leadership vs. focused on individual contribution For each trait, you take a result from 1-5 (show spinners)"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: Should colleagues be able to submit feedback multiple times for the same manager profile? ‚Üí A: Allow unlimited submissions - each submission from same colleague overwrites their previous response
- Q: Can managers see individual colleague responses, or only aggregate data? ‚Üí A: Managers can see both individual responses (who said what) and aggregates
- Q: How should managers access their results - do they use the same link as colleagues, or get a separate manager view? ‚Üí A: Manager gets a separate admin/results link when creating the profile
- Q: Who can configure the trait questions - should each manager customize their own profile's questions, or is it a global system configuration? ‚Üí A: Hardcoded questions only - no configuration allowed (just easy to change in code)
- Q: How long should profile and response data be retained? ‚Üí A: Indefinitely - data never expires or gets deleted

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A manager in a tech company wants to gather feedback from colleagues about their preferred leadership mindset. The manager creates a profile without needing to sign up or log in, receives a shareable link, and distributes it to colleagues. Each colleague opens the link, rates the manager on four trait dimensions using a 1-5 scale, and submits their feedback. After submitting, colleagues see aggregate results from all respondents displayed as a radar chart, providing the manager with crowd-sourced guidance on team expectations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** no existing profile, **When** a manager creates a new profile, **Then** the system generates two unique links: a feedback link (for colleagues) and an admin link (for the manager)
2. **Given** a manager receives their admin link, **When** they open it, **Then** they see a results dashboard with individual and aggregate feedback data
3. **Given** a valid feedback link, **When** a colleague opens it, **Then** they see four trait questions each with a 1-5 rating spinner
4. **Given** a colleague has filled out all four ratings, **When** they submit the form, **Then** their responses are recorded and they see a success confirmation
5. **Given** a colleague has just submitted feedback, **When** viewing the success screen, **Then** they see aggregate results from all respondents displayed as a radar chart
6. **Given** multiple colleagues have submitted responses for a profile, **When** any colleague submits feedback, **Then** the radar chart reflects the combined data from all submissions
7. **Given** a manager wants to share their profile, **When** they access their feedback link, **Then** they can copy/share the link via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: sharing mechanism - clipboard, social media buttons, QR code?]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a colleague tries to submit with incomplete ratings (not all 1-5 values selected)?
- What happens when no one has submitted feedback yet - does the radar chart show anything?
- When a colleague resubmits feedback, how does the system identify them to overwrite the previous response?
- What happens if a colleague navigates away mid-completion - is their progress saved?
- How does the system handle simultaneous submissions from multiple colleagues?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow a manager to create a profile without authentication or account creation
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate two unique links for each created profile: a feedback link (for colleagues) and an admin/results link (for the manager)
- **FR-003**: System MUST display exactly four trait questions to colleagues who access a profile link:
  - Takes on risk vs. Risk averse
  - Goofy vs. Professional
  - Candid vs. Diplomatic
  - Focused on leadership vs. Focused on individual contribution
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a 1-5 rating scale (spinner control) for each trait question
- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent submission unless all four ratings are selected [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: or should partial submissions be allowed?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST save colleague feedback responses when submitted
- **FR-007**: System MUST display a success confirmation screen after successful submission
- **FR-008**: System MUST display aggregate results as a radar chart on the success screen
- **FR-009**: Radar chart MUST show combined data from all respondents for that profile
- **FR-010**: Trait questions MUST be hardcoded in the application but structured for easy modification by developers (no runtime configuration interface required)
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide a results dashboard accessible via the manager's admin link, displaying both aggregate and individual responses
- **FR-012**: System MUST retain profile and response data indefinitely with no automatic expiration or deletion
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow colleagues to resubmit feedback for the same profile, with each new submission overwriting their previous response
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow managers to view both individual colleague responses (including respondent identity) and aggregate results
- **FR-015**: System MUST capture and display colleague identity alongside their feedback responses

### Key Entities
- **Profile**: Represents a manager's feedback collection session. Contains two unique identifiers: one for the feedback link (shared with colleagues) and one for the admin link (for manager results access). Associated with multiple feedback responses.
- **Trait Question**: Represents one dimension being rated (e.g., "Takes on risk vs. Risk averse"). Has two opposing labels and accepts ratings from 1-5.
- **Feedback Response**: Represents one colleague's submission for a profile. Contains four trait ratings (one per question), colleague identity information, and timestamp.
- **Aggregate Results**: Calculated summary of all feedback responses for a profile, displayed as radar chart. Shows average (or other metric) for each trait dimension.
