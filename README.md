README.md

This app is a fun tool that allows an manager in a tech company to ask colleagues to give them input on what kind of mindset they should have.
The core user journey is:
- I create my profile (no authentication!)
- I get a link to my profile and share it with colleagues
- When a colleage opens the screen, they see a list of questions and for each question I can configure the trait
- When a colleague submits the traits, then they see a success screen and a summary of how everyone configured the profile (for example a radar chart)
The list of questions is hardcoded, but should be easily configurable.
Start with:
- Takes on risk vs. Risk averse
- Goofy vs. professional
- Candid vs. diplomatic
- Focused on leadership vs. focused on individual contribution
For each trait, you take a result from 1-5 (show spinners)


This app uses React + Tailwind + React Query on Frontend
And uses Kotlin on Backend + Mongodb
I do not know the Kotlin ecosystem well enough so I would need to have to set it up (Kotlin, Mongodb etc.).
